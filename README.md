question 1) seee intro.html

question 2) the number of pokeballs that can fit in the tower depends on the volume of the pokeball and the volume of the tower 
    1) we need to find the volume of the tower so we convert everything to meters then did the area times the height 
      #64m = 210ft height of tower; area is 74,050 ftÂ² = 6879.4701m; volume is about 440 286.086m^^3
    2) we needed the size of the pokeball boulbapedia tells us its about the size of a baseball at full size so 
      about 235mm or 23.5 cm in diameter
    3) using this diameter the radus is 11.75 then we input this into the volume formula for volume of the sphere 
    to get 0.0067951994598677715 m^3 
    4) to get the number of pokeballs that fit in the tower we divide the tower volume by the pokeball volume and round down 
      to get 64793695 pokeballs 
      
      i also wrote a nifty script for it since pokeballs vary in size
